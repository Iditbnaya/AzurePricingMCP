## Reference Tables

Quick reference for service names, regions, and best practices.

### Common Azure Service Names

Service names are case-sensitive. Use exact names for best results.

| Service | API Name |
|---------|----------|
| Virtual Machines | `Virtual Machines` |
| Storage | `Storage` |
| SQL Database | `Azure SQL Database` |
| Cosmos DB | `Azure Cosmos DB` |
| Kubernetes | `Azure Kubernetes Service` |
| App Service | `Azure App Service` |
| Functions | `Azure Functions` |
| OpenAI | `Azure OpenAI` |

### Common Azure Regions

| Region Code | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| `eastus` | US East |
| `eastus2` | US East 2 |
| `westus2` | US West 2 |
| `centralus` | US Central |
| `westeurope` | West Europe |
| `northeurope` | North Europe |
| `uksouth` | UK South |
| `eastasia` | East Asia |
| `southeastasia` | Southeast Asia |
| `japaneast` | Japan East |

### Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use specific SKU names | `D4s_v5` not `D4` - avoids ambiguity |
| Use lowercase region codes | API requires `eastus` not `East US` |
| Compare savings plans | 1yr and 3yr options can save 30-60% |
| Try fuzzy discovery | `azure_sku_discovery` finds services with approximate names |
| Specify currency | Add `currency_code=EUR` for non-USD pricing |

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Results

- Service name misspelled or wrong case
- SKU doesn't exist in that region
- Region code incorrect (use lowercase)

**Solution:** Start with broader search, then add filters.

### Unexpected Prices

- Check Spot vs On-Demand pricing
- Windows pricing is ~2x Linux
- Verify unit (per-hour vs per-month)

### Too Many Results

- Add region or SKU name filters
- Use `limit` parameter
